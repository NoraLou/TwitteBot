I think I did it again
Come all ye young fellows that follows the sea.
To me, way hey, blow the man down.
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Now please pay attention and listen to me.
Give me some time to blow the man down.
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh baby
When a trim Black Ball liner's preparing for sea
It might seem like a crush
There's tinkers and tailors, shoemakers and all
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious.
'Cause to lose all my senses.
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, baby
Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Come quickly, lay aft to the break of the poop.
Oh baby, baby
Oops!...You think I'm in love.
You'll split your sides laughing such sights you would see
That I'm sent from above.
For kicking Jack Rogers commands the Black Ball..
I'm not that innocent.
